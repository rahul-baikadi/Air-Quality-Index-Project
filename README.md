03/22/24- This project outlines the data cleaning and analysis process applied to an Air Quality data. The process involves importing libraries, cleaning the dataset by removing NA values, renaming columns for clarity, converting object values into appropriate data types, and handling outliers. The cleaned dataset is then visualized to identify trends, correlations, and outliers in air quality indicators such as Carbon Monoxide, Benzene, and Nitrogen Oxides.
